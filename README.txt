The package `quantity` provides classes for unit-safe computations with
quantities.

Defining a quantity class
=========================

A **basic** type of quantity is declared just by sub-classing the class
`Quantity`:

    >>> class Length(Quantity):
    ...     pass

In addition to the new quantity class the meta-class of class `Quantity`
creates a corresponding class for the units automatically. It can be
referenced via the quantity class:

    >>> Length.Unit
    <class 'quantity.quantity.LengthUnit'>

If the quantity has a unit which is used as a reference for defining other
units, the simplest way to define it is giving a name and a symbol for it as
class variables. The meta-class of class `Quantity` will then create a unit
automatically:

    >>> class Length(Quantity):
    ...     refUnitName = 'Meter'
    ...     refUnitSymbol = 'm'
    >>> Length.refUnit
    Length.Unit('m')

Now, this unit can be given to create a quantity:

    >>> METER = Length.refUnit
    >>> print(Length(15, METER))
    15 m

If no unit is given, the reference unit is used:

    >>> print(Length(15))
    15 m

Other units can be derived from the reference unit (or another unit), giving
a definition by multiplying a scaling factor with that unit:

    >>> MILLIMETER = Length.Unit('mm', 'Millimeter', Decimal('0.001') * METER)
    >>> MILLIMETER
    Length.Unit('mm')
    >>> KILOMETER = Length.Unit('km', 'Kilometer', 1000 * METER)
    >>> KILOMETER
    Length.Unit('km')
    >>> CENTIMETER = Length.Unit('cm', 'Centimeter', 10 * MILLIMETER)
    >>> CENTIMETER
    Length.Unit('cm')

Using one unit as a reference and defining all other units by giving
a scaling factor is only possible if the units have the same scale. Otherwise,
units have to be instantiated via the coresponding class `Unit` sub-class
without giving a definition.

    >>> class Temperature(Quantity):
    ...     pass
    >>> CELSIUS = Temperature.Unit('°C', 'Degree Celsius')
    >>> FAHRENHEIT = Temperature.Unit('°F', 'Degree Fahrenheit')

**Derived** types of quantities are declared by giving a definition based on
more basic types of quantities:

    >>> class Volume(Quantity):
    ...     defineAs = Length ** 3
    ...     refUnitName = 'Cubic Meter'
    >>> class Duration(Quantity):
    ...     refUnitName = 'Second'
    ...     refUnitSymbol = 's'
    >>> class Velocity(Quantity):
    ...     defineAs = Length / Duration
    ...     refUnitName = 'Meter per Second'

If no symbol for the reference unit is given with the class declaration, a
symbol is generated from the definition, as long as all types of quantities
in that definition have a reference unit.

    >>> print(Volume.refUnit.symbol)
    m³
    >>> print(Velocity.refUnit.symbol)
    m/s

Instantiating quantities
========================

The simplest way to create an instance of a class `Quantity` subclass is to
call the class giving an amount and a unit. If the unit is omitted, the
quantity's reference unit is used (if one is defined).

    >>> Length(15, MILLIMETER)
    Length(Decimal(15), Length.Unit(u'mm'))

Alternatively, the two-args infix operator '^' can be used to combine an
amount and a unit:

    >>> 17.5 ^ KILOMETER
    Length(Decimal('17.5'), Length.Unit(u'km'))

Also, it's possible to create a `Quantity` sub-class instance from a string
representation:

    >>> Length('17.5 km')
    Length(Decimal('17.5'), Length.Unit(u'km'))

Unit-safe computations
======================

A quantity can be converted to a quantity using a different unit by calling
the method `Quantity.convert`:

    >>> l5cm = Length(Decimal(5), CENTIMETER)
    >>> l5cm.convert(MILLIMETER)
    Length(Decimal('50'), Length.Unit('mm'))
    >>> l5cm.convert(KILOMETER)
    Length(Decimal('0.00005'), Length.Unit('km'))

Quantities can be compared to other quantities using all comparison operators
defined for numbers. Different units are taken in to account automatically, as
long as they are compatible, i. e. a conversion is available:

    >>> Length(27) <= Length(91)
    True
    >>> Length(27, METER) <= Length(91, CENTIMETER)
    False

Quantities can be added to or subtracted from other quantities ...

    >>> Length(27) + Length(9)
    Length(Decimal(36))
    >>> Length(27) - Length(91)
    Length(Decimal(-64))
    >>> Length(27) + Length(12, CENTIMETER)
    Length(Decimal('27.12'))
    >>> Length(12, CENTIMETER) + Length(17, METER)
    Length(Decimal('1712'), Length.Unit('cm'))

... as long as they are instances of the same quantity type:

    >>> Length(27) + Duration(9)
    quantity.quantity.IncompatibleUnitsError: Can't add a 'Length' and a
        'Duration'

Quantities can be multiplied or divided by scalars, preserving the unit:

    >>> 7.5 * Length(3, CENTIMETER)
    Length(Decimal('22.5'), Length.Unit(u'cm'))
    >>> Duration(66, MINUTE) / 11
    Duration(Decimal(6), Duration.Unit(u'min'))

Quantities can be multiplied or divided by other quantities ...:

    >>> Length(15, METER) / Duration(3, SECOND)
    Velocity(Decimal(5))

... as long as the resulting type of quantity is defined ...:

    >>> Duration(4, SECOND) * Length(7)
    UndefinedResultError: Undefined result: Duration * Length

... or the result is a scalar:

    >>> Duration(2, MINUTE) / Duration(50, SECOND)
    Decimal('2.4')
